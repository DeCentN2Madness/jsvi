TODO:
 - undo chain
 - redo spelling (currently commented out sinec I am missing the cgi)
 - bind esc to ctrl-[
 - % navigation 
 - support for surround (a) and in methods (i) for example di{ to delete inbetween { and }
 - :help 
 - :version
 - multiple window support
 - uneditable sections?
 - a ruler at the 72 character mark? possibly word-wrapping?
 - want to switch between vi/emacs modes?
 - do I even want emacs mode?
 - the toolbar is kind of ugly- possibly replace with an image-version-
   or more likely- replace with styled buttons
 - macro recording and playback
 - get rid of use of window.on*** events, switch to addEventListener

BUGS:

 - esc does not exit visual mode
 - ctrl-w closes window in chrome
