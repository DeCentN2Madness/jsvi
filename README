Original Description:

jsvi is a vi-clone written in pure javascript and should work
in any modern web-browser. jsvi is Â© 2006-2008 Internet Connection,
and is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3 or (at your option) any later version.

Internet Connection has been providing high-quality web and email
hosting since 1994, and we have a unique developer-centric offering
that can help you build web applications faster.

administrators that are very comfortable with Internet technologies.

We can help you with any application you may want to use- including
those that you are developing yourself.

If you don't know vi, you can use the arrow-keys as well to scroll
around this document.

jsvi has a finger-feel of vi, supports many ed/ex commands, is
unicode-aware, supports real-time, check-as-you-type spell checking, a small
subset of HTML for useful for physical markup of text, and host clipboard
integration.

Regarding vi compatibility, jsvi supports almost all vi-keys, and
almost all ed/ex (:) commands including <b>:ha</b>rdcopy, and <b>:g//m0</b> but
noticeably missing are <b>:i</b> and commands that work similar to it, as
well as certain register operations.

Regarding vim compatibility, jsvi supports vim's VISUAL and VISUAL-LINE
modes for selections, and has support for a few of vim's motion commands, but
for the most part, jsvi is a clone of vi and not vim.

It is <b>not</b> based on the so-called "Rich Editor" that is
built into modern Firefox builds, and MSIE, and as a result, works
reliably on Safari and Opera.

Some keys, are trapped by your browser, and as a result, simply will not
function- these keys probably work in another web-browser.
